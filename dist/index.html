                            <p>OpinioNation creates an online community that connects people who have questions with people who have answers. The mantra of OpinioNation is: "Ask a question. Give an Answer. Get involved". The site favors visual, bite-sized, fun, lightweight engagement.

                            <h2>My Part</h2>
                            <p>I was responsible for much of the front-end layer of the app, including the aesthetic &amp; design, user experience, and use of AngularJS to consume data from the back-end. I was also heavily involved in the ideation phase, data modeling, app architecture, and building the API with Ruby on Rails.</p>
                            <p>I also invested heavily into making OpinioNation more performant. Because on any page visit one might load in tens of large images and hundreds of DOM elements, we needed to keep things loading asynchronously. This also meant reducing as much unnecessary and redundant code.</p>

                            <p>Fetch is a fun way for dog owners to connect on a platform made specifically for them! Combining great modern technologies aimed at creating an unparalleled user experience, it aims to take all the anxiety out of meeting people who are like you.</p>

                            <h2>Conception</h2>
                            <p>Fetch was a two-week project that my partner, Shawn, and I built. On the Tuesday following demos for our previous projects, Shawn thought of Fetch while driving home to Ventura. When he told me about it the next morning, I couldn't be more excited – I was looking to build something that was fun for us to design and develop, not to mention for people to use!</p>

                            <h2>Process</h2>
                            <p>We eagerly began working, and at the end of our two-week journey, Fetch became the AngularJS app that leverages our Ruby on Rails API it is today. My experience building Fetch with Shawn was an absolute joy, and I'm proud of the front-end side of the app for which I am responsible for.</p>
